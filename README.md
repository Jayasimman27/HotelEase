# Hotel Management System

## Overview
The **Hotel Management System** is a comprehensive and user-friendly application built using strong Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java. Designed to simplify hotel operations, the system offers tools to efficiently manage rooms, employees, customers, and various hotel departments.

This project employs key OOP concepts such as: **Encapsulation** **Inheritance** **Polymorphism**
  **Abstraction**

The user interface is developed using **Java Swing**, offering an interactive and visually appealing experience. The modular design ensures that administrators and receptionists can easily navigate through features like adding rooms, managing employees, and handling customer check-ins and check-outs.

With a SQL database seamlessly integrated for persistent storage and a modern UI for ease of use, this system is ideal for medium to large-sized hotels looking to optimize their workflows and enhance operational efficiency.
